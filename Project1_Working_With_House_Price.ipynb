        "\n",
        "In machine learning, overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that occur when training models. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building robust and accurate machine learning models. Let's take a closer look at each:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Overfitting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting occurs when a model performs exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize well on new, unseen data. It happens when the model becomes too complex or overly flexible, effectively \"memorizing\" the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. Key characteristics of overfitting include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The model shows low training error but high test error.\n",
        "- The model captures noise and irrelevant details in the training data.\n",

        "### 2. Underfitting:\n",
        "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple or inflexible to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. It fails to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test data. Key characteristics of underfitting include:\n",

The goal is to find the right level of complexity that allows the model to generalize well to new, unseen data.

It aims to improve model performance, reduce computational complexity, and enhance interpretability by focusing on the most informative and influential features. Feature selection helps mitigate the curse of dimensionality and can lead to more accurate and efficient models.\n",

        "- Forward Selection: This method starts with an empty set of features and iteratively adds the most significant feature that improves the model's performance the most until a stopping criterion is met.\n",

        "### 2. Shrinkage Methods:\n",
        "Shrinkage methods, also known as regularization methods, add a penalty term to the objective function during model training. These methods encourage sparse solutions, effectively shrinking less important feature coefficients towards zero. Two popular shrinkage methods are:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 1. Ridge Regression:\n",
        "Ridge regression is a regularization technique that adds an L2 penalty term to the linear regression objective function. The penalty term is the sum of the squared values of the model's coefficients. It helps reduce overfitting by shrinking the coefficients only very close to zero. Ridge regression is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Lasso Regression:\n",
        "Lasso regression is another regularization technique that adds an L1 penalty term to the linear regression objective function. The penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the model's coefficients. It encourages sparsity by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. Lasso regression is helpful when you want to identify the most relevant features for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. ElasticNet Regression:\n",
        "ElasticNet regression combines both L1 and L2 regularization terms in the linear regression objective function. It offers a balance between the feature selection capability of Lasso regression and the coefficient shrinkage of Ridge regression. ElasticNet regression is useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets and multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Decision Tree Regression:\n",
        "Decision tree regression builds a regression model by recursively partitioning the data based on feature values. It predicts the target variable based on the average target value of the training instances within each leaf node. Decision tree regression can capture complex relationships and handle both numerical and categorical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. Random Forest Regression:\n",
        "Random forest regression is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It improves the predictive accuracy and handles overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple trees. Random forest regression is robust, can handle high-dimensional data, and provides feature importance rankings.\n",

A default threshold of 0.5 is often used, meaning if the probability is >= 0.5, it's classified as positive (loan approved), otherwise negative (loan not approved). To reduce False Positives (classifying 'N' as 'Y' incorrectly):\n",

        "> Increase the threshold: If you increase the threshold (e.g., to 0.6 or 0.7), the model will require a higher probability to predict 'Y'. This will make the model more conservative in predicting 'Y', thereby reducing the number of False Positives. However, this might increase False Negatives (classifying 'Y' as 'N' incorrectly).\n",
