# Project 1: House Price Prediction and Deployment

## Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning regression pipeline to predict house prices, covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and basic deployment.

## Key Steps

Cleaned and preprocessed raw housing data (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)

Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends and key price-driving features

Applied feature engineering to improve model performance

Trained and evaluated regression models using appropriate metrics

Implemented a basic deployment workflow to make predictions usable in practice

## Tools & Concepts
Python • Pandas • NumPy • EDA • Regression • Feature Engineering • Model Evaluation • Deployment Basics
## Outcome
Demonstrated the full lifecycle of a supervised learning problem, from raw data to deployable model.



# Project 2: Feature Selection Methods Comparison for COVID-19 Regression

## Overview
This project investigates how different feature selection (FS) methods affect regression model performance when predicting COVID-19 related outcomes.

## Key Steps

Applied multiple feature selection techniques to identify influential predictors

Trained regression models using different feature subsets

Evaluated and compared model performance across selection methods

Analyzed trade-offs between prediction accuracy, model complexity, and interpretability

Documented experimental results and insights clearly

## Tools & Concepts
Python • Feature Selection • Regression • Model Evaluation • Statistical Reasoning • Comparative Analysis
Outcome
Showcased structured experimentation and a deeper understanding of how feature selection impacts model stability and generalization.
